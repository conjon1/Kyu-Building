Code wars questions and answers, more of a personalcatalog or progress tracker

I do use ChatJippty but more or so to find new ways to approach a problem

For exsample I used ChatGPT on how to use the set() function in python and other use cases for it anf how to manipulate set() to what I need 


I also use it to help debug code and spellcheck me
